# Bravo sample configuration.

[bravo]
# Try to enable Ampoule. This can massively improve server responsiveness, but
# it can cause crashes, misrendering, and other weird bugs. You have been
# warned.
# DO NOT ENABLE ON WIN32. IT CAN CAUSE SERVER LOCKUPS.
#ampoule = yes
ampoule = no

# Try to use the fancy console.
fancy_console = true

[world example]
# This is just an example world. World names come from the name of the
# section; this section describes a world called "example".

# The port to listen on. All of the normal port rules apply; you probably
# cannot use ports below 1024 without root permissions.
port = 25565

# The folder to use for storing the world. Make sure you have write
# permissions to this folder. If it does not exist, it will be created.
# Relative paths are allowed but discouraged.
#url = file://relative/path/to/world
url = file:///absolute/path/to/world

# Which seasons to enable for this world.
# ~ winter: Spread snow over the world, and freeze bodies of water
# ~ spring: Thaw everything
seasons = winter, spring

# Which serializer to use for saving worlds to disk.
# ~ alpha: The Alpha NBT format
# ~ beta: The Beta NBT/MCR format
# Note: There is currently no automatic conversion from alpha to beta!
serializer = beta

# Authenticator. There are only two options:
# ~ offline: anybody can log in, no authentication is done
# ~ online: only people logged into minecraft.net can log in
# Bravo also supports the password authentication scheme; see the docs for
# details.
#authenticator = online
authenticator = offline

# This option enables a permanent cache of geometry, which persists regardless
# of the number of clients connected to this world. It greatly speeds up login
# at the cost of memory usage. This option will also cause the world to
# generate geometry even when no clients are connected, to keep the cache
# full. It is highly recommended to keep this cache enabled. The level of
# caching done is dependent on the number used. 3 is the minimum required to
# let clients login immediately with no glitches; 10 is the level of caching
# done by Notchian servers.
perm_cache = 3

# Plugins.
# Bravo's plugin architecture is quite complex. It is absolutely essential to
# remember that plugins are ordered, and that order matters.

# Dig hooks. The ones you probably want:
# ~ give: causes pickups to be dropped when appropriate.
# ~ replace: causes replaced blocks to spawn when needed.
# Additionally, you probably want either alpha_snow or bravo_snow for snow
# support.
#dig_hooks = give, replace, alpha_snow
dig_hooks = give, replace, bravo_snow, alpha_sand_gravel, torch

# Build hooks. The important ones:
# ~ build: place blocks
# ~ build_snow: ensure correct block placement on snow
# ~ tile: make workbenches, furnaces, etc. work
# Additionally, there are a few other good build hooks.
# ~ torch: Orient torches
build_hooks = build_snow, torch, tile, build, bravo_snow, alpha_sand_gravel

# Terrain generators.
# Some important generators:
# ~ erosion: make dirt appear
# ~ watertable: provide water
# ~ grass: self-explanatory, I hope
# ~ safety: bedrock and other safety essentials
# You'll probably want simplex, complex, or some other terrain provider, as
# well.
#generators = boring, erosion, watertable, grass, safety
generators = simplex, erosion, watertable, beaches, grass, safety
